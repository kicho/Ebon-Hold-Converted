In order to have custom teleport locations specific to your guild, you will need to modify the Config file.

1. First you need to enable becose by Default is desable
   To enable TeleNPC.HarmonyGuildShip you need to put 1
   To enable TeleNPC.UnityGuildShip you need to put 1
    

1. The ID number of your guild. To get the ID number, open your database (I use SQLyog), open the 'Characters' database, and look at the 'Guild' table.
    by Default 
    GuildId1 ( for TeleNPC.HarmonyGuildShip ) = 1
    GuildId2 ( for TeleNPC.UnityGuildShip ) = 1


2. This is where you need to change the coordinates to match your guild's house.
    by Default Gm Island
   ( for TeleNPC.HarmonyGuildShip )
    MapID1 = 1
    X_pos1 = 16225.11
    Y_pos1 = 16251.11
    Z_pos1 = 12.7

  ( for TeleNPC.UnityGuildShip )
    MapID2 = 1
    X_pos2 = 16225.11
    Y_pos2 = 16251.11
    Z_pos2 = 12.7


3. Save the file. You are now ready to use.


###### TeleNPC How to Add more Guild House ######
In order to add more custom teleport locations specific to your guild, you will need to modify the telenpc.cpp file and config file.


Open the telenpc.cpp. As you can see there, you need to add a few things:

1. First you must go to // Guild Only Teleport Options and add this after the last guilid house

// Check config file if "XGuild1" option is enabled or not
	if(EnableXGuild1)
	if(pPlayer->GetGuildId() == (SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("GuildId3",0))) pPlayer->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM( 5, "XGuild1", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, xxxx);


2. New you must go to /////////GUILD///////// and thenre add this after the last guilid house

case xxxx: //XGuild1 (if enabled in scriptdev2.conf)
	pPlayer->CLOSE_GOSSIP_MENU();
	// Read coordinates from config file
	pPlayer->TeleportTo(SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("MapID3",13),SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("X_pos3",0),SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("Y_pos3",0),SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("Z_pos3",0),0);
	pPlayer->ModifyMoney(-(SD2Config.GetFloatDefault("TeleGoldCost",0)));
break;

Replace the xxxx with the last number from guild house +5
If the last number is 4030 you well fave to put 4035 in both case ( in case xxxx: //XGuild1 (if enabled in scriptdev2.conf) and in pPlayer->ADD_GOSSIP_ITEM( 5, "XGuild1", GOSSIP_SENDER_MAIN, xxxx); from menu)
Save the file. You are now ready to use the cpp file.


3. New open the conf file and add this after the last guilid house

TeleNPC.XGuild1 = 0
    GuildId3 = 1
    MapID3 = 1
    X_pos3 = 16225.11
    Y_pos3 = 16251.11
    Z_pos3 = 12.7


Replace XGuild1 with the name you want to add.
You can add more guilid house but when you add more edit (GuildId3 , MapID3 , X_pos3 , Y_pos3 , Z_pos3) set +1 if the last guilid have (GuildId3 , MapID3 , X_pos3 , Y_pos3 , Z_pos3 ) the next guilid house will have (GuildId4 , MapID4 , X_pos4 , Y_pos4 , Z_pos4) in both cases (telenpc.cpp and config file)
